# Telco Churn Prediction using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

## Overview

This project aims to predict customer churn for a telecommunications company using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Churn prediction is crucial for businesses to identify customers who are likely to leave, allowing proactive measures to retain them. ANN, a powerful machine learning technique inspired by the human brain's structure, is employed here for its ability to capture complex patterns in data.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of historical customer data including demographics, usage patterns, and churn status. It is sourced from [provide dataset source or link]. The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize numerical features.

## Model Architecture

The ANN model architecture consists of an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Each layer contains multiple neurons (nodes) connected to neurons in adjacent layers through weighted connections. The activation function used in the hidden layers is typically ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), while the output layer uses a sigmoid function to output churn probabilities.

## Training

The model is trained using the backpropagation algorithm with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimization. The training process involves iteratively adjusting the weights of connections to minimize the difference between predicted churn probabilities and actual churn status in the training data. To prevent overfitting, techniques such as dropout and early stopping are employed.

## Evaluation

The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC AUC. These metrics provide insights into the model's ability to correctly classify churners and non-churners. Additionally, techniques like cross-validation are used to ensure the model's generalizability to unseen data.

## Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Ensure the dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize numerical features.
2. **Model Training**: Train the ANN model using the preprocessed dataset. Experiment with different architectures, hyperparameters, and regularization techniques to optimize performance.
3. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the trained model using various metrics to assess its performance. Use techniques like cross-validation to ensure robustness.
